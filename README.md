# timeTracker
The Backend is written with the Spring Framework. 
The Frontend is written with Angular.
So you will need to set up both Frameworks to use this application.
For an easier start I added an embedded H2-DB. It is also possible to use an MySql Server.
You just have to delete the #comments in the application.properties and swith out the database dependency in the pom file.
To start the Spring application you should just have to write in mvnw in .
To start the Angular application just use npm install and after that ng serve.
